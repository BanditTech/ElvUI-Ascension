Copy (or drag and drop) ElvUI, ElvUI_OptionsUI, ElvUI_AscensionExtendedUI and ElvUI_Enhanced into your Wow-Directory\Interface\AddOns

Place the Patch-Y.mpq file into Wow-Directory\Data

If there is already a patch file with Patch-Y.mpq then use another letter.

The location to place the file is inside the Data folder of your Client install.

If you installed into the default location then you will find it in:

Ascension Launcher\resources\client\Data\

You will know you found the proper install directory when you see several other Patch-[A-Z].mpq files.

When you finish this, you can relaunch WOW and the install should be complete.
